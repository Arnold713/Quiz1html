This code includes both the quiz functionality and the CSS styles. The CSS styles are included in a 
`<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML file, and the quiz functionality is included in a 
`<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>` section. The quiz functionality uses JavaScript to display 
the questions and answers, check if the selected answer is correct, and go to the next question.
